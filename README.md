# Collision-Detection-with-an-Occluded-Vehicle-for-Autonomous-Driving
<p align="justify">
Vehicles on road will often occlude other vehicles posing serious challenges to handle by human intelligence. According to the report of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration on road accidents say that 31% are caused due to rear-end collisions. These accidents happen mainly due to the occlusions caused by the front or the side vehicles while shifting the lanes. It poses a great challenge to navigate for humans as well as for the Autonomous Vehicles too. Autonoumous car's are said to be safer than the manually driven cars but these are even lacking in that area.
So to tackle this problem we leveraged the Computer Vision algorithms and implemented an Collision detector algorithm to avoid collisions with occluded vehicles to increase the safety. This can be used as ADAS for alerting the driver.

Tensorflow Object Detection algorithms are used to detect the vehicle by transfer learning and implemented an algorithm to find the number of occlusions and the vehicle causing that occlusion.
